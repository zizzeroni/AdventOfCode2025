# Advent of Code - Git Ignore Configuration

This repository follows the Advent of Code (AoC) rules for organizing inputs and outputs during puzzle solving. To comply with the event's guidelines and best practices, I ignore certain files in the Git history.

### Reason for `.gitignore` Configuration

The `.gitignore` has been set up to **ignore all `input.txt` and `text.txt` files** in every subfolder. This is done in compliance with Advent of Code’s rules which suggest not sharing or committing puzzle input files publicly. These input files are specific to each puzzle day and should not be included in version-controlled repositories, as per the guidelines.

### About the Solutions

Please note that the solutions in this repository are **not optimized** nor **highly focused** on performance. They are simply **algorithms I’ve written to enjoy the challenge** of the puzzle and **done in my spare time**. These solutions are more about **learning and exploring different approaches** rather than crafting the most efficient or production-ready code.

If you're looking for highly optimized, real-world solutions, this repository may not be what you're after. But if you're interested in seeing how I tackled the puzzles and approached the challenges, feel free to explore!

Happy coding and enjoy the Advent of Code!
